	(1) Propositional Logic

1- The proposition is a declarative sentence (fact) its either true or false
2- if there is unknown variable like (x) then it wont be a proposition --> because we dont know its value. like x+3=5 we dont know x value.

3- ( Not --> ¬ ) the negation of ( p--> proposition ) so it gives the oppsite value of the p if its true then it will make it false.

4- ( AND --> ∧ ) if (p and q --> propositions ) to make the statment true you must have both of p and q true and if one of then false then the statemnt is false.

5- ( OR --> ∨ ) if ( p and q --> propositions ) to make the statment true just need one of them to be true and to make it false it needs both of p and q to be false.

6- ( XOR --> ⊕ ) if ( p and q --> propositions ) to make the statment true one of them must be true and other be false for example if p true and the q is false then the statment is true if both of them true then it will be false.

7- the difference bettween ( OR and XOR) OR only need one proposition to be alway true . But XOR its true only if p and q are oppsite.

8- The conditional statement: (p,q --> propositions) if p, then q this means p --> q. the only case that make this statement wrong when p is true and q is false other wise its always true.

9- if p is false then the statement will be always true ,and if the q is true then always the statement is true. Assume that q is a big circle and p is part of this circle.

10- Assume that (p,q --> propositions). The inverse: -p --> -q.

11- converse: q --> p.

12- contrapositive -q --> -p.

13- Biconditional (p,q --> propositions). p if and only if q  ( p <--> q ) it can be written as ( p --> q ) ∧ ( q --> p) its true only in two cases if both of p,q are true or both of p,q false. and the statement is false if one of them is true and other is false. (the opposite of XOR).

14- The truth table: if we have two propositions then we will make 2^2 =4 this means will be two true and two false if its 3 propositions then it will be 2^3=8 this means will be 4 true and 4 false. So its 2^number of propositions.

15- The priority in the truth table to be done at first the negation(~) then both (AND / OR) then conditional then biconditional.

16- Translating to English if p =  Ahmed is playing. and we want ~p so we say --> Ahmed isn't playing. if we want to put (AND /OR) if we got anther proposition like q = Ahmed is eating ice-cream. so if we want p ∧ q we say --> Ahmed is playing and Ahmed is eating ice-cream. if we want p ∨ q we say --> Ahmed is playing or Ahmed is eating ice-cream. if we want to use conditional
p --> q the we say if Ahmed is playing ,then Ahmed is eating ice-cream. if we want to use biconditional p <--> q we say Ahmed is playing if and only if Ahmed is eating ice-cream.

17- note we can use (1 instead of true) and we can use (0 instead of false).

18- Tautology --> always true (if all the output of the table true then its tautology).

19- contradiction --> always false (if all the output of the table is false then its contradiction).

20- contingency --> neither a tautology nor contradiction.

21-
